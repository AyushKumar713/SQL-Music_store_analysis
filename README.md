# SQL-Music_store_analysis
n this project, I used SQL to analyze the sales data of a music store. The analysis involved identifying top-selling products, tracking sales trends over time, and segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior. I performed revenue analysis across different regions and categories, and created optimized SQL queries to extract and report key insights. This project highlights how SQL can be used to derive actionable insights from large datasets
